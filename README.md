# üß≥ Travel Booking Application

Welcome to **Wanderlust**, a comprehensive travel booking application! This Django-based project was developed as part of my assignment for the Software Engineer Intern position I am applying to **Travel Lykke**. I‚Äôve named the project **Wanderlust** to capture the spirit of adventure and exploration. 

Thank you for exploring the application!

## üåü Project Motivation

This project was created to showcase proficiency in Django, building functional web applications, and understanding travel booking systems. It was created using Django for the backend, Bootstrap for the frontend, and MySQL as the database.

## üì¶ Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Travel Options**: Browse and book various travel options (Flights, Trains, Buses).
- **Booking Management**: Make, view, and cancel bookings.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced with Bootstrap for a clean, modern look.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

This application is hosted on AWS Lightsail at [15.207.196.96:8000](http://15.207.196.96:8000). Unfortunately, I couldn't afford a proper domain name, so I used the free IP address given by AWS Lightsail. The free domain name options were not desirable, so I went let the IP address be.
